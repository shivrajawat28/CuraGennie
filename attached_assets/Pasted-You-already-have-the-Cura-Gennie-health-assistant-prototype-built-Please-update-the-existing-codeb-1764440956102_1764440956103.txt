You already have the Cura Gennie health assistant prototype built.

Please update the existing codebase with the following changes, WITHOUT breaking current layout and logic:

========================
1) Improve Symptom Entry Input
========================

Goal: Replace the basic symptom text input with a smarter, multi-select symptom input that:
- Shows suggestions as the user types (e.g. "Fev" → "Fever")
- Allows selecting multiple symptoms
- Stores symptoms as an array
- Still sends these to the backend symptom analysis API.

Implementation details:

1. Create a reusable `SymptomInput` component (or update the existing symptom input field) with:
   - A text input where user can type symptom names.
   - A predefined list/array of common symptoms, for example:
     ```ts
     const COMMON_SYMPTOMS = [
       "Fever",
       "Headache",
       "Cough",
       "Cold",
       "Sore throat",
       "Chest pain",
       "Shortness of breath",
       "Fatigue",
       "Body ache",
       "Nausea",
       "Vomiting",
       "Loose motions",
       "Abdominal pain",
       "Dizziness",
       "Back pain",
       "Skin rash",
       "Itching",
       "Red eyes",
       "Burning urination"
     ];
     ```
   - As the user types, show a dropdown of matching suggestions from this list (case-insensitive).
   - When the user clicks a suggestion, it should be added as a “chip”/“tag” below the input (e.g. Fever, Headache, etc).
   - User should also be able to press Enter to add the current input text as a custom symptom (if not in the list).
   - Each chip should have a small “x” icon to remove that symptom.

2. The selected symptoms should be stored in state as an array, e.g.:
   ```ts
   const [symptoms, setSymptoms] = useState<string[]>([]);
and this array should be used wherever the symptom data is sent to the backend (for the analyze symptoms API).

Ensure that:

The "Analyze Symptoms" button sends the updated array of symptoms.

Existing age, gender, duration, vitals etc. fields still work as before.

UI remains responsive and consistent with the current design (Tailwind classes, cards, etc).

========================
2) Update Header / Navbar (remove Symptom Checker tab)
Goal: Clean up navigation by removing the extra “Symptom Checker” item from the header.

Locate the Navbar/Header component (e.g., Navbar.tsx or equivalent).

Remove the "Symptom Checker" navigation link from the header.

Keep the other nav items like:

Home

Articles

Doctors

About

Medicine Info (if it exists as a header option)

Ensure layout is still centered/aligned properly on desktop and mobile.

========================
3) Upgrade Medicine Info Feature (Text + Image Upload, Safer Content)
Goal: In the "Medicine Info" feature:

Let the user either TYPE the medicine name OR UPLOAD a clear tablet/strip image.

Show a disclaimer under the image upload.

Show richer information from the backend: what it’s used for, category, precautions, common side effects, similar medicines with approximate prices, and safe external links — WITHOUT giving dosage/timing.

A) UI changes (Medicine Info section / modal):

In the Medicine Info UI (modal, drawer, or page), add two input methods:

Option 1: Text input for medicine name (e.g. "Dolo 650", "Paracetamol", etc.)

Option 2: File upload for tablet image (using <input type="file" accept="image/*" />).

You can either:

Use two tabs: “By Name” and “By Image”
OR

Show both fields one after the other, with clear labels.

Under the image upload field, add a disclaimer text, for example:

“Please ensure the medicine strip/tablet image clearly shows the brand name and strength.
This feature is for basic information only, not for prescriptions or dosage.”

Add a button like:

“Get Medicine Info”
which triggers a request to the backend. The logic should:

Prefer the typed name if provided.

If no text is provided but an image is uploaded, call the image-based endpoint or placeholder.

Keep the UI clean:

Use cards to show the returned info.

Maintain the app’s theme (Cura Gennie styling, Tailwind classes, rounded corners, etc.).

B) Backend changes for medicine info (text-based):

Ensure there is a backend route like:

POST /api/medicine-info
that accepts JSON body:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "Dolo 650"
}
and optionally:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "Dolo 650",
  "source": "image" // optional
}
This backend handler should:

Use the OpenAI API (or whichever AI model you configured) to construct a SAFE, NON-PRESCRIPTIVE response.

The AI/system prompt must explicitly:

Avoid giving dosage (mg, tablets per day, timing).

Avoid saying “take this medicine” or direct instructions.

Focus only on:

What conditions this medicine is generally used for.

Drug type/category.

General precautions and warnings.

Common side effects.

Important safety notes.

Equivalent / alternative brands (same composition) with approximate price ranges.

A note that user should follow doctor’s advice and the label on the pack.

The backend should return a structured JSON like:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "Dolo 650",
  "generic_name": "Paracetamol",
  "used_for": [
    "Fever",
    "Mild to moderate pain"
  ],
  "category": "Analgesic and antipyretic",
  "general_precautions": [
    "Do not exceed the maximum daily dose on the label.",
    "People with liver or kidney problems should consult a doctor before use."
  ],
  "common_side_effects": [
    "Nausea",
    "Mild stomach discomfort (in some users)"
  ],
  "important_warnings": [
    "Overdose can cause serious liver damage.",
    "Keep out of reach of children."
  ],
  "equivalent_medicines": [
    {
      "brand": "Calpol 650",
      "generic_name": "Paracetamol",
      "approx_price": "₹20–₹40 per strip"
    },
    {
      "brand": "Crocin 650",
      "generic_name": "Paracetamol",
      "approx_price": "₹25–₹45 per strip"
    }
  ],
  "pharmacy_links": [
    {
      "label": "View on partner pharmacy",
      "url": "https://example-pharmacy.com/search?query=Dolo%20650"
    }
  ],
  "disclaimer": "This app does not provide dosage or timing. Always follow your doctor and the medicine label."
}
On the frontend, display this information nicely in the Medicine Info UI:

Top: Medicine name + generic name.

Sections for:

Used for

Category

General precautions

Common side effects

Important warnings

Equivalent medicines with approx. price (in a small table or card grid).

A CTA button “View on partner pharmacy” that just opens the URL in a new tab (no internal checkout or payment flow).

Show the disclaimer in a clearly visible style (e.g., red or muted but bold).

C) Image-based flow (for now, minimal implementation):

For the image upload, if you don’t yet implement real image recognition:

Either call the same /api/medicine-info endpoint with a hardcoded placeholder name and show a “demo result”.
OR

Show a “Coming soon: image-based medicine recognition” message after upload.

The main requirement is that the UI supports image upload cleanly, with the disclaimer and proper layout.

========================
General Requirements
Keep all existing core functionality working (symptom analysis, results UI, articles, doctors, footer, etc.).

New changes must be fully responsive.

Follow the existing code style (React + TypeScript + Tailwind).

Do not introduce any dosage or timing instructions for medicines.

Always include disclaimers in both symptom analysis results and medicine info views.
