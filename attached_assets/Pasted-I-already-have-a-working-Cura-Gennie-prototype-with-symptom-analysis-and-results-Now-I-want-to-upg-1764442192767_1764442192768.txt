I already have a working Cura Gennie prototype with symptom analysis and results.

Now I want to upgrade the RESULT section and CONDITION DETAIL flow.

IMPORTANT: The app must NOT prescribe medicines or give exact dosage, timing, or “how to take” instructions.  
It should only:
- Suggest possible conditions
- Explain them in simple language
- Focus on prevention, self-care, and awareness
- Recommend what type of doctor to consult
- Show a list of doctors (mock data)
- For medicines: mention “commonly used medicine types/classes” with a strong disclaimer, but NO dosage, NO frequency, NO instructions like “take 1 tablet 3 times a day”.

================================
1) Add Back Button in Result View
================================

Currently, after symptom analysis, the user sees a Result section with possible diseases/conditions.

Update this Result section so that:

- At the top of the results area, add a simple button:
  - Label: “← Back to Symptom Entry”
  - On click:
    - Takes the user back to the symptom entry form section (either via navigation, scroll, or route change depending on the current structure).
    - For SPA style:
      - If we’re using conditional rendering (e.g., `showResults` state), then clicking this should set `showResults = false` and show the symptom input again.

Make sure:
- The button is styled consistently with the app (Tailwind, rounded, subtle hover).
- It is clearly visible above the results list.

========================================
2) Clickable Conditions → Detail Page
========================================

Right now, the symptom analysis shows “Possible diseases/conditions” with very short descriptions.

I want each condition card to be clickable so that:

- When the user clicks on a condition (e.g., “Viral Fever”, “Migraine”),
- It opens a **dedicated Condition Detail Page** (or a full-screen modal) with multiple sections.

You can implement this using React Router pages like:
- `/conditions/:slug`
OR a modal that receives the condition data.

-----------------------
Condition Detail Layout
-----------------------

On the Condition Detail page, show the following sections in order:

1) **Condition overview**
   - Name of the condition
   - Short introduction in simple, user-friendly language
   - A small tag showing severity level (e.g., Mild / Moderate / Needs Attention)

2) **How does this condition happen? (Causes & Effects)**
   - Section title: “How does this condition happen?”
   - Bullet points or small paragraphs covering:
     - Common causes
     - What is happening in the body in a simple way
     - Typical effects/symptoms in general (not diagnosing the user)

3) **How to reduce the risk and prevent worsening**
   - Section title: “How can you take care of yourself?”
   - Subsections:
     - “Prevention & daily care”
       - General lifestyle and habit tips
       - Simple do’s and don’ts
     - “Exercises, yoga, and movement”
       - Light, safe activities that may help (walking, stretching, breathing exercises, etc.)
       - Avoid heavy or risky activities if not suitable

4) **Social contact and going outside**
   - Section title: “Should you go outside or meet people?”
   - Explain in simple language:
     - When it is better to rest at home
     - When light outdoor activity is okay
     - When to avoid crowded places or close contact (e.g., fever, cough, infection risk)

5) **How your friends/relatives/guardians can help**
   - Section title: “How can others help you?”
   - Bullet points like:
     - Help you stay hydrated
     - Monitor warning signs
     - Make sure you rest, eat, and take care
     - When they should immediately help you contact a doctor/hospital

6) **Important safety disclaimer (red box)**
   - A clearly visible red-highlighted note, for example:
     > “Important: The information on this page is for awareness only.  
     > It is NOT a medical diagnosis or prescription.  
     > Always consult a qualified doctor before taking any medicine or starting treatment.”

7) **Common medicine categories used (NON-PRESCRIPTIVE)**
   - Section title: “Common treatment approaches (for doctors)”
   - This section must:
     - Talk about medicine **categories or classes** (e.g., “pain relievers”, “antipyretics”, “antibiotics if prescribed by a doctor”), NOT exact regimens.
     - Avoid giving exact dosage, tablet count, timings, or “how to take”.
     - Use general phrasing like:
       - “Doctors may sometimes use [medicine class] for this type of condition, depending on the case.”
   - The data should be structured from backend like:

     ```json
     "treatment_overview": {
       "common_medicine_classes": [
         "Pain relievers (analgesics)",
         "Fever reducers (antipyretics)",
         "Sometimes antibiotics if a bacterial infection is confirmed by a doctor"
       ],
       "non_medicine_care": [
         "Rest and hydration",
         "Diet and lifestyle changes",
         "Monitoring symptoms"
       ]
     }
     ```

   - Under this, repeat a strong disclaimer:
     > “The medicines mentioned here are general categories that doctors may consider.  
     > This is NOT a prescription. Do not start or change any medicine without consulting a doctor.”

   - DO NOT generate examples like “Take X mg 3 times a day” or “take this tablet with water before food”.  
     This must be avoided completely.

8) **Suggested doctors for this condition**
   - Section title: “Doctors who can help with this condition”
   - Using the condition’s `recommended_specialist` (e.g., “General Physician”, “Dermatologist”, “Cardiologist”), fetch from a backend/mock list of doctors for that specialty.
   - Show cards for 3–5 doctors:
     - Name
     - Specialty
     - Experience (e.g., “8+ years experience”)
     - Location/City
     - Rating (e.g., ⭐ 4.5)
     - Approx consult charges (e.g., “₹400–₹700 per consult”)
     - Badges like “Video consult available” / “Clinic visit”
   - Each doctor card should have:
     - A button: **“Book Appointment”**
     - A button: **“Video Call (Coming Soon)”** or a disabled button with info
   - For now, booking can just open a modal or toast: “Booking integration coming soon”.

----------------------------------------
Backend change for Condition Detail Page
----------------------------------------

When the user clicks a condition from the result list, the frontend can:

- Either:
  - Pass the condition object via route state/context, if the data is already rich enough.
- Or:
  - Call a backend endpoint:
    - `GET /api/condition-detail?name=<conditionName>`
  - Backend uses OpenAI (or the configured AI model) to generate a structured JSON with fields like:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "Viral Fever",
    "severity": "moderate",
    "overview": "Short plain-language description...",
    "causes_and_effects": [
      "Usually caused by viral infection such as ...",
      "May lead to high temperature, body pain, weakness, etc."
    ],
    "self_care": {
      "prevention_and_daily_care": [
        "Rest in a cool, comfortable environment",
        "Stay hydrated with water and oral fluids",
        "Avoid very heavy or junk food"
      ],
      "exercises_and_yoga": [
        "Very light stretching if you feel comfortable",
        "Gentle breathing exercises",
        "Avoid intense workouts during fever"
      ]
    },
    "social_and_outdoor_guidance": [
      "Avoid crowded places while you have fever or cough",
      "Wear a mask if you need to go out",
      "Try to minimise close contact to reduce spread"
    ],
    "support_from_others": [
      "Family can help you by reminding you to drink fluids",
      "They can watch for warning signs like very high fever or confusion",
      "They should help you reach a doctor if your condition worsens"
    ],
    "treatment_overview": {
      "common_medicine_classes": [
        "Pain relievers (analgesics)",
        "Fever reducers (antipyretics)"
      ],
      "non_medicine_care": [
        "Rest and adequate sleep",
        "Light, easy-to-digest food",
        "Hydration and electrolyte balance"
      ]
    },
    "recommended_specialist": "General Physician",
    "disclaimer": "This information is for awareness only, not a diagnosis or prescription."
  }
The backend’s AI prompt MUST:

Avoid dosage amounts, tablet counts, schedules, or direct instructions.

Never say “take this medicine” in a prescriptive way.

Always add a strong disclaimer.

================================
3) Keep Legal & Safety Boundaries
Throughout this change:

Do NOT implement or generate:

Exact medicine names with dosing schedules.

Instructions like “take 1 tablet 3 times a day with water”.

Step-by-step treatment regimens.

Focus on:

Awareness

Education

Self-care and lifestyle

When to see a doctor

What type of doctor to see

Mock doctor listing and booking buttons

All new UI should be responsive, match the existing design/theme of Cura Gennie, and keep the experience smooth for hackathon demo.
