1) Symptom Entry Page – extra field + subtle animated background

File(s): whatever file currently renders the main “Check Symptoms” section on the home page.

a) Add “Upload Medical History (Optional)”

Inside the Check Symptoms card, after the Vitals section but before the “Analyze Symptoms” button:

Add a new optional block with label:
“Upload Medical History (Optional)”

Under it, add helper text in small, muted text:
“Upload lab reports, prescriptions, or previous diagnosis notes to help improve the AI context.”

Add a file upload area styled like a drag-and-drop card:

Dashed border

Light teal / mint background on hover

Icon of a document or upload arrow

Text:
“Click to upload or drag & drop medical records (images or PDFs)”

For now, you don’t need to implement backend upload logic – just wire it to a local file input and store the selected file(s) in component state.

Make sure this whole section is clearly marked as optional.

b) Add a very light animated shimmer / gradient background behind the symptom card

Keep the current clean, premium medical look – no heavy animation.

Behind the main symptom checker card, add a very soft animated background:

Use a subtle gradient or shimmer effect that moves slowly.

Colors should stay in the current palette: light teal / mint / very soft blue.

Animation must be very low intensity so it doesn’t distract or cause motion sickness.

Implementation idea (but choose any clean approach):

Add an absolutely-positioned div behind the card with a gradient background.

Add a slow CSS animation (e.g. gradient shift or shimmer left-to-right over 10–20 seconds).

Keep opacity low (opacity-20 or similar) so content remains easy to read.

2) Results Page – improve interactions and back button

File(s): the page that shows “Based on your inputs, here’s what we found”.

a) Back button spacing + stronger icon

At the top, where it says “Back to Symptom Entry” (or “Back to Results” on condition page later):

Add a bit more left margin/padding so it doesn’t stick to the edge.

Use a slightly bolder / clearer back icon (e.g. larger arrow icon, h-5 w-5 or similar).

Keep text + icon aligned nicely and clickable as one button with hover state (slight underline or tint).

b) Make each “Possible Conditions” card feel clickable

For each condition card (e.g., “Viral Upper Respiratory Infection”, “Seasonal Allergies”):

Ensure the entire card is a clickable region, not just the text.

Add hover styling:

Slight lift (shadow-lg + -translate-y-0.5 with transition).

Very soft border or background highlight (border-teal-200 or bg-teal-50).

Keep it subtle and premium.

c) Improve “Tap to see full details and guidance” text

Make this text look more like an interactive link:

On hover: add underline + color change (e.g. from teal-600 to teal-700).

Smooth transition-colors and transition-all.

Optionally add a small right arrow icon that slightly shifts to the right on hover.

3) Doctors Page – filters, hover animation, and price

File(s): the page that shows “Recommended Specialists” / doctor cards.

a) Add mini filter bar at the top of the doctor list

Above the doctor cards, add a simple filter row:

A dropdown / segmented control for Speciality

Options like: “All”, “General Physician”, “Cardiologist”, “Dermatologist”, etc.

A dropdown for Experience

Example options: “Any”, “5+ years”, “10+ years”.

A dropdown or slider for Consultation Fees

Example options: “Any”, “₹0–₹500”, “₹500–₹1000”, “₹1000+”.

For now, filters can work on static dummy values, but set up the state so it’s easy to plug in real data later.

Make the filter bar clean and compact, aligned with current visual style.

b) Add subtle hover lift animation to doctor cards

For each doctor card:

On hover:

Slight lift (-translate-y-1)

Slight shadow increase (shadow-xl)

Smooth transition-all duration-200.

Cursor should become pointer.

c) Show consultation price on doctor card

On each doctor card, display doctor’s video consultation fee:

Add a line like:
“Video Consultation: ₹799” (use realistic dummy data per doctor).

Style it in a slightly bold, but not shouty way.

Place it near availability info or above the “Book” button.

Ensure it looks aligned on both desktop and mobile.

4) Condition Detail Page – illustrations and warning icon animation

File(s): the page that opens when user clicks on a condition (e.g. “Viral Upper Respiratory Infection” details).

a) Add simple vector-style illustrations

Add a small medical illustration near the top title or inside the first section.

Use a flat 2D vector style (simple, clean, soft teal / blue tones).

It can be:

A lungs / throat icon for respiratory conditions,

Or a generic health illustration that fits all conditions.

You can use:

Either a local SVG in /public or /assets, OR

Simple icon combinations styled bigger.

Make sure it doesn’t overpower text – just adds visual interest.

b) Important Safety Note – animated warning icon

In the red “Important Safety Note” box:

Keep the text exactly as is (legal disclaimer).

Add a warning/alert icon on the left.

Give the icon a very subtle bounce or pulse animation:

Slow, small scale animation (e.g. gently pulsing every 2–3 seconds).

Use Tailwind + custom keyframes or simple CSS.

Make sure the animation is minimal and not annoying.

5) Footer – polish links, border, and mini heartbeat animation

File(s): the footer component.

a) Link spacing + hover underline

Increase vertical spacing between link items (Quick Links, Legal).

On hover:

Change link color slightly darker teal.

Add underline with smooth transition-colors & transition-all.

b) Add a faint gradient top border

At the top of the footer, add a 1–2px gradient line:

For example: left to right from teal-300 → cyan-300 → teal-300.

Use a div or border using bg-gradient-to-r.

It should be subtle, just to visually separate footer from body.

c) Heartbeat animation beside logo

Next to the “Cura Gennie” logo or text in the footer:

Add a small heart or heart-monitor icon.

Apply a very subtle heartbeat animation:

Quick double-pulse, then rest, repeating slowly.

Low intensity (no huge scale jumps).

Keep it consistent with brand colors (teal/light red combo, or teal only).

General Requirements

Keep design consistent with the current Cura Gennie branding:

Same font stack

Similar corner radius

Same teal/mint/white palette.

Don’t break existing routes or remove existing copy.

Wherever you add motion, keep it subtle and premium, not cartoonish.

Make sure everything remains fully responsive (desktop + mobile).

Implement all of the above changes now in the existing codebase.
