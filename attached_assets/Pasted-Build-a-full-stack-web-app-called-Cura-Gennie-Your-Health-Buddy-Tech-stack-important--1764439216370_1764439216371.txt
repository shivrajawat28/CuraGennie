Build a full-stack web app called **Cura Gennie – Your Health Buddy**.

⚙️ Tech stack (important)
- React + TypeScript for frontend
- Node.js (or Next.js API routes) for backend
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use a proper backend API layer: no hardcoded demo result. Every symptom query must call a real backend endpoint.
- Use environment variables for keys (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`), never hardcode them.

High-level concept:
Cura Gennie is **not a prescription or diagnosis app**.  
It is a **health awareness assistant** that:
- Takes user symptoms + basic info
- Sends that to an AI-powered backend
- Returns:
  - Possible conditions (with probability percentages)
  - Friendly explanations and prevention guidance
  - Lifestyle tips, what to do / what to avoid
  - Recommended specialist type (e.g., General Physician, Cardiologist)
  - Suggested nearby doctors (from mock or pre-seeded data)
- Also has a **Medicine Info** feature that tells users:
  - What a medicine is generally used for
  - Type/class of drug
  - General precautions and warnings
  - Common side effects
  - Strong disclaimer: “Follow your doctor and medicine label for dosage and timing.”

Absolutely NO:
- No dosage (mg, tablets per day)
- No “take before/after food”
- No prescribing or telling user exactly how to take medicines
- No claiming to diagnose or cure

========================
UI / UX
========================

Overall style:
- Friendly, modern, clean health-tech UI
- Soft teal / cyan / pastel blue primary colors
- Lots of white space, rounded cards, smooth hover animations
- Fully responsive: looks great on mobile, tablet, desktop
- Include a light/dark mode toggle in the header

Pages / Sections:
- Home (main)
- Symptom Checker (core feature section)
- Articles / Guides
- Doctors
- About
- A global “Medicine Info” UI entry (via header)

========================
1) Header / Navbar
========================

Create a sticky header with:

Left:
- Circular logo icon (placeholder) next to app name
  - Text:
    - Big: **Cura Gennie**
    - Small subtitle: **Your Health Buddy**

Center / Right:
- Nav links: Home, Symptom Checker, Articles, Doctors, About
- “Medicine Info” button in the header that opens a modal/drawer
- A “Login / Sign Up” button (UI only, no real auth required for now)
- A theme toggle (light/dark mode)

On scroll:
- Keep the header sticky with slight blur and a subtle shadow.

========================
2) Symptom Checker (Main Home Section)
========================

On the homepage, under the header:

Left side:
- Hero text:
  - Title: “Health made simple with Cura Gennie”
  - Subtitle: “Understand what your symptoms could mean, how to take care of yourself, and which doctor to talk to.”

Right side (or below on mobile):
- A Symptom Checker card with the following fields:

Form fields:
- **Symptoms** (multi-select + free text)
  - User types symptom words (e.g. “fever”, “headache”, “chest pain”)
  - Show suggestions as tags/chips
- **Age** (number)
- **Gender** (dropdown: Male / Female / Other)
- **Duration of symptoms**
  - Dropdown: Less than 1 day, 1–3 days, 3–7 days, More than a week
- **Optional Vitals**:
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Pulse (bpm)
  - SpO₂ (%)
  - BP (text field)

At the bottom:
- Primary button: **“Analyze Symptoms”**
- On click:
  - Call a backend endpoint: `POST /api/analyze-symptoms`
  - Show a loading state while waiting
  - Then display the results section below the form

Design:
- Card with gradient border or soft glow
- Rounded corners, subtle shadow
- Inputs spaced nicely, labels clear

========================
3) Backend: Symptom Analysis API
========================

Create a backend endpoint:
- `POST /api/analyze-symptoms`
- Input JSON body:
  ```json
  {
    "symptoms": ["fever", "headache"],
    "age": 21,
    "gender": "male",
    "duration": "1-3 days",
    "vitals": {
      "temperature": 38.5,
      "pulse": 90,
      "spo2": 97,
      "bp": "120/80"
    },
    "location": "user city (optional)"
  }
