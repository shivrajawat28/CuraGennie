Build a full-stack web app called **Cura Gennie – Your Health Buddy**.

⚙️ Tech stack (important)
- React + TypeScript for frontend
- Node.js (or Next.js API routes) for backend
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use a proper backend API layer: no hardcoded demo result. Every symptom query must call a real backend endpoint.
- Use environment variables for keys (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`), never hardcode them.

High-level concept:
Cura Gennie is **not a prescription or diagnosis app**.  
It is a **health awareness assistant** that:
- Takes user symptoms + basic info
- Sends that to an AI-powered backend
- Returns:
  - Possible conditions (with probability percentages)
  - Friendly explanations and prevention guidance
  - Lifestyle tips, what to do / what to avoid
  - Recommended specialist type (e.g., General Physician, Cardiologist)
  - Suggested nearby doctors (from mock or pre-seeded data)
- Also has a **Medicine Info** feature that tells users:
  - What a medicine is generally used for
  - Type/class of drug
  - General precautions and warnings
  - Common side effects
  - Strong disclaimer: “Follow your doctor and medicine label for dosage and timing.”

Absolutely NO:
- No dosage (mg, tablets per day)
- No “take before/after food”
- No prescribing or telling user exactly how to take medicines
- No claiming to diagnose or cure

========================
UI / UX: Gen Z + Healthcare Feel
========================

Overall style:
- Friendly, modern, clean health-tech UI
- Soft teal / cyan / pastel blue primary colors
- Lots of white space, rounded cards, smooth hover animations
- Fully responsive: looks great on mobile, tablet, desktop
- Include a light/dark mode toggle in the header

Pages / Sections:
- Home (main)
- Symptom Checker (core feature section)
- Articles / Guides
- Doctors
- About
- A global “Medicine Info” UI entry (via header)

========================
1) Header / Navbar
========================

Create a sticky header with:

Left:
- Circular logo icon (placeholder) next to app name
  - Text:
    - Big: **Cura Gennie**
    - Small subtitle: **Your Health Buddy**

Center / Right:
- Nav links: Home, Symptom Checker, Articles, Doctors, About
- “Medicine Info” button in the header that opens a modal/drawer
- A “Login / Sign Up” button (UI only, no real auth required for now)
- A theme toggle (light/dark mode)

On scroll:
- Keep the header sticky with slight blur and a subtle shadow.

========================
2) Symptom Checker (Main Home Section)
========================

On the homepage, under the header:

Left side:
- Hero text:
  - Title: “Health made simple with Cura Gennie”
  - Subtitle: “Understand what your symptoms could mean, how to take care of yourself, and which doctor to talk to.”

Right side (or below on mobile):
- A Symptom Checker card with the following fields:

Form fields:
- **Symptoms** (multi-select + free text)
  - User types symptom words (e.g. “fever”, “headache”, “chest pain”)
  - Show suggestions as tags/chips
- **Age** (number)
- **Gender** (dropdown: Male / Female / Other)
- **Duration of symptoms**
  - Dropdown: Less than 1 day, 1–3 days, 3–7 days, More than a week
- **Optional Vitals**:
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Pulse (bpm)
  - SpO₂ (%)
  - BP (text field)

At the bottom:
- Primary button: **“Analyze Symptoms”**
- On click:
  - Call a backend endpoint: `POST /api/analyze-symptoms`
  - Show a loading state while waiting
  - Then display the results section below the form

Design:
- Card with gradient border or soft glow
- Rounded corners, subtle shadow
- Inputs spaced nicely, labels clear

========================
3) Backend: Symptom Analysis API
========================

Create a backend endpoint:
- `POST /api/analyze-symptoms`
- Input JSON body:
  ```json
  {
    "symptoms": ["fever", "headache"],
    "age": 21,
    "gender": "male",
    "duration": "1-3 days",
    "vitals": {
      "temperature": 38.5,
      "pulse": 90,
      "spo2": 97,
      "bp": "120/80"
    },
    "location": "user city (optional)"
  }
The backend should:

Use the OPENAI_API_KEY and call the OpenAI API (chat/completions) with a strong system prompt that:

Says this is NOT a diagnostic or prescription tool

Only lists possible conditions and general advice

Avoids naming specific medicine dosages or timings

Focuses on:

Possible conditions and probabilities

General explanation

Self-care & prevention tips

When to see a doctor

What kind of specialist to consult

Parse the AI response into a structured JSON object.

Example response JSON structure (from backend to frontend):

json
Copy code
{
  "conditions": [
    {
      "name": "Viral Fever",
      "probability": 65,
      "severity": "moderate",
      "summary": "Short explanation of what this condition usually is.",
      "how_it_happens": "Simple explanation of common causes.",
      "what_you_can_do": [
        "Rest and hydration",
        "Monitor temperature",
        "Avoid heavy physical activity"
      ],
      "what_others_should_do": [
        "Help you stay hydrated",
        "Monitor warning signs",
        "Encourage rest"
      ],
      "lifestyle_tips": [
        "Light meals",
        "Plenty of fluids",
        "Avoid alcohol and smoking"
      ],
      "recommended_specialist": "General Physician"
    },
    {
      "name": "Migraine",
      "probability": 25,
      "severity": "mild",
      "summary": "...",
      "what_you_can_do": ["..."],
      "what_others_should_do": ["..."],
      "lifestyle_tips": ["..."],
      "recommended_specialist": "Neurologist"
    }
  ],
  "overall_summary": {
    "primary_condition": "Viral Fever",
    "overall_severity": "moderate",
    "important_signs_to_watch": [
      "Very high fever",
      "Difficulty breathing",
      "Persistent chest pain",
      "Confusion"
    ],
    "when_to_seek_urgent_care": [
      "If symptoms suddenly worsen",
      "If new severe symptoms appear"
    ]
  },
  "recommended_specialist": "General Physician",
  "disclaimer": "This is not a diagnosis. Please consult a qualified doctor."
}
The backend must:

ALWAYS include a disclaimer

Never suggest exact medication dosage or prescribing statements

========================
4) Symptom Results UI
On the frontend, show the result as:

Title: “Based on your inputs, here’s what we found”

Section 1: Possible Conditions

Cards for each condition:

Name

Probability (with progress bar or circular percentage)

Severity badge (Mild / Moderate / Needs attention)

Short summary

Expand/collapse or “View details” for:

How it usually happens

What you can do

What people around you can do to help

Lifestyle and prevention tips

Section 2: Summary Box

Primary suspected condition

Overall severity level

Recommended specialist type

Patient info recap: age, gender, key symptoms, duration

Section 3: Doctor recommendation + mock booking

Use the recommended_specialist field to filter from a local mock doctor list on backend.

Backend should return:

json
Copy code
{
  "doctors": [
    {
      "name": "Dr. Rohan Sharma",
      "specialization": "General Physician",
      "experience": "8+ years",
      "city": "Noida",
      "consult_modes": ["Video", "Clinic"],
      "approx_fee": "₹400 - ₹600"
    }
  ]
}
Show top 3 doctors matching that specialty.

Each card should have a button:

“Book Appointment” (mock, just show a toast or “Coming soon” modal)

“Start Video Call” (mock, disabled or info text)

This is enough for prototype; no real payment or video infra needed.

Bottom:

Disclaimer in red:
“This is not a medical diagnosis. Please consult a qualified doctor before making any health decisions.”

========================
5) Medicine Info Feature (Header → Modal)
In the header, add a “Medicine Info” item or button.
On click, open a modal or drawer with:

Fields:

Input: Medicine Name

Optional: dropdown for form (tablet/syrup) (UI only)

Submit button:

“Check Medicine Use”

On submit:

Call backend endpoint: POST /api/medicine-info

Body:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "Dolo 650"
}
Backend behavior:

Use OpenAI API (or a safe medicine info knowledge source if available) to return:

What conditions this medicine is GENERALLY used for (e.g., “fever and mild to moderate pain”)

Type/category (e.g., “Paracetamol-based pain reliever and antipyretic”)

General precautions (e.g., liver safety, avoid overdose)

Common side effects in generic terms

Warnings like “Do not exceed recommended dose on the package”, “People with liver disease must talk to a doctor”

Strong disclaimer that:

App does NOT tell user when, how much, or how often to take it

User must follow doctor + package instructions

The medicine-info JSON structure should look like:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "Dolo 650",
  "generic_name": "Paracetamol",
  "used_for": [
    "Fever",
    "Mild to moderate pain"
  ],
  "category": "Analgesic and antipyretic",
  "general_precautions": [
    "Do not take more than the maximum daily dose mentioned on the package.",
    "People with liver or kidney disease should consult a doctor before use."
  ],
  "common_side_effects": [
    "Nausea",
    "Stomach discomfort (in some people)"
  ],
  "important_warnings": [
    "Overdosing can cause serious liver damage.",
    "Keep out of reach of children."
  ],
  "disclaimer": "This app does not provide dosage or timing. Always follow your doctor's advice and the medicine label."
}
Frontend:

Display this in a clean card layout inside the modal.

Make the disclaimer very clear and visually distinct.

========================
6) Articles / Guides Section
Create an “Articles” page + mini section on Home:

Each article:

Has a title (e.g. “How to manage recurring headaches safely”)

Short description

A cover image (simple placeholder or relevant illustration)

On click:

Navigate to /articles/[slug] or open a detailed view

Detailed article should:

Explain the condition in simple language

Focus on prevention and lifestyle

Clearly say to consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment

Use static mock data for articles stored locally (e.g. JSON or TS file).

========================
7) Doctors Page
Create a “Doctors” page showing:

Filters:

City (dropdown or text)

Specialist type

Consult mode (Video / Clinic)

List of doctors from local mock data:

Name

Specialization

Experience

Location

Languages (like “Hindi, English”)

Approx fee

Button: “Book Video Consult” (mock)

This should reuse the same doctor card style as the Symptom Results section.

========================
8) About + Footer + Legal
About Page:

Short story of what Cura Gennie does

Clear statement:

It helps with awareness, not diagnosis

It uses AI to generate explanations but users must verify with real doctors

Footer:

Links: Home, Articles, Doctors, About, Terms, Privacy

App name + mini logo

Big disclaimer:

“Cura Gennie is not a medical device, diagnosis, or treatment tool.
All information is for educational purposes only.
Always consult a qualified healthcare professional.”

========================
Final Important Notes:
Every AI-related backend route MUST:

Use OPENAI_API_KEY from environment variables.

Add guardrails in the system prompt:

No prescriptions or dosage.

No guaranteeing diagnosis.

Only general health information and prevention tips.

Every response shown to user should contain a disclaimer somewhere in the UI.

All results should depend on the ACTUAL input (symptoms, age, duration etc.), not fixed sample data.

There should be NO hardcoded single result for all users; the app must call the backend every time with the user’s data.
